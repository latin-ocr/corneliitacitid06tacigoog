THE ACCOUNT GIVEN ΒΥ TACITUS 31

The picture is not indeed wholly without its other side, when the

candour of the historiari asserts itself against the desire to idealize.
Itis admitted that their independence is even excessive¹, that they
are torn to pieces by internal feuds2, impulsive and unsteady in
battle ³, indolent and quarrelsome in peace ⁴, predatory⁵‚ drunlren⁶‚
absorbed by the passion for gambling⁷; in lact that their finer
qualities are by no means without the vices which in a low state of
civilization are apt to go with them.
, ΙΙη attempting to gather the description of the country and its
people into generalizations‚ we are often haffled by difficulties probably
due to unexplained diversity. The discrepancies between Caesar and
Tacitus, or those between Tacitus and himself, or between either of
them and the earliest later knowledge, may often arise from the
different stages of civilization ol different tribes, and lrom the attempt
to disguise variations under a condensed general statement. Some-
times distinctions are drawn, but they may have been oltener omitted
where they exist. We are told, for instance, that royalty had its
grades, srom the most despotic to the most limited⁸ ; it was perhaps
no less true that there were free states with and without permanent
chief magistrates ⁹. Wandering lise, sustained by flocks and herdS,
would hardly have'given way everywhere to settled dwellings and
agriculture in the 150 years between Caesar and Tacitus if it had
not been already partial and on the wane at the time ol the former¹⁰ ; '
hunting, though it may have declined, could· hardly at the earlier
date have been a general pursuit‚ except among a certain class and
in favourable districts ¹¹ 3 in religion, Caesar may have given us the
lowest and most popular, Tacitus the more advanced conception of
divinity¹².

It is perhaps lor the same reason that our descriptions often give
us traces ol an institution conrplicated or crossed by something
different ¹³. Patriarehal government has still its survivals ¹⁴, and the
family tie is still ol extreme importance 15; even the more primitive
