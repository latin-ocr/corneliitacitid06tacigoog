to a rent in kind¹. Other slaves, reduced to servitude by their own
reckl'ess gambling, are described as not kept, but sold abroad².
Freedmen also constitute a distinct class, of whom he only tells us
that, while insignificant elsewhere, and little above the slave, they
became extremely influentia} under kings ³. It must be assumed that
they at least resembled the bondsman in exclusion from the franchise,
and had no independent status apart lrom their lord or patron.
Another intermediate class, of whom Tacitus tells us nothing, would
be the ‘ingenui’ who had no land, and had to work as free labourers

' ior hire, or in some other way to accept a position oi clientship⁴.

It is much to be regretted that we are not told more of the local
and tribal government which was even at that date established in
· the Germanic race. lt was no doubt the case that government of
any kind in Germany had to struggle against a far stronger sentiment
ol individual independence than in Gaul: it is clear, however, that the
scattered homesteadS, described as built by each as and where he
would, are in some sense ‘vici’ or parts os such ⁶. Probably the
military organization preceded the civil ⁶, the families or clans mar-
shalled together in the host⁷ received their allotments of land together ⁸,
or a ‘Dori ' of dependants grew up round the ‘Hos’ of a leader⁰.

Any identity in blood between the members oi villages would naturally
be shortlived, and the tie would become political only, as in its
counterpart, the English ‘township¹⁰.' The most important feature
. in the German ‘vicus' at this date is that the free village community
was possessor os the land ¹¹, apportioning it in some way among

occupiers, and that it had a court ¹² or council of its own, which must Ἴ
have been competent to settle disputes on these or other local matters, ·
