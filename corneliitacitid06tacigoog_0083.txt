2. exterior Oceanus, explained by
‘ignotum mare'; probably the Baltic
is meant. The traders in this region
would be the Suiones os e. 44, a.

a general term to mean that the material

Tbat the Germans spun tiax at this time
is attested by Pliny (19.1‚ 2, 8), and
implements lor spinning and weaving
are as old in Europe as the Swiss lake-

colour resembling purple dye.

comparison to be rather with the ‘ stola ’
os Roman women. On the Antonine
column the women are represented with
an undergarment reaching to the ieet,
aud a short tunic over it. This tunic
has usually long sleeves, but iu some
instances (see Bartoli, pl. 17, 49, 63)

by their ancient laws, nor unusual in
north Germany, besides being excep-
