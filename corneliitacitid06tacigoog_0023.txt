characteristic corresponding gemndive genitive¹ is wholly absent, as
is also the use of a participle in the ablative absolute as predicate,
with a sentence as subject²z also the instances of condensation by
zeugma are comparatively lew ³, whereas in the Annals they are more
numerous than in any other prose author.

On the other hand, there are many ways in which his rhetorical
exuberance is less subdued than when his historical style had become
more ripe; and the emphasis which in his later writings would rather
be studied by skillul arrangement of words is here osten given by the
sort of expansion used hyan orator to drive home his point to his
listeners. Thus what is called ‘anaphora' or the repetition for ⁸
emphasis of an adjective, pronoun, adverb, διο, is especially fre-
quent⁴z frequent also is a general redundancy of expression, some·
times in the form ol pleonasm, as ‘initium incohatur' (c. 30, 1), much
oltener by combination of nearly if not quite synonymous expres·
sions⁵, as ‘recenset nuper additum’ c, 2, 5), ‘propriam et sinceram ⁴

et sui similem' (wiburn atque operum' (Q‘lucos ac
nemora’ (Q temere ac fortuito’ Q), ‘constituunt . . .

‘vis et potentia' (c. 42, 2), ‘rude . . . informe' (c. 45, 5). Some-
times rhetorical point is given by alliteration, as ‘mutuo metuant
montibus' §pff-1), ‘terrent trepidantve' (c. 3, 1), ‘sudore . . . san·
guine' (ciffi), ‘pace. . . proelio' (effi ‘ lamenta et lacrimas’
