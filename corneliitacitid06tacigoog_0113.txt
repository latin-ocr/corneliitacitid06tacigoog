100 CORNELII T ACIT I DE GERMANIA

dius quam tutius fuit, quia inter inpotentes et validos salso
quiescas: ubi manu agitur, modestia ac probitas nomina
superioris sunt. ita qui olim boni aequique Cherusci, nunc2
inertes ac stulti vocantur: Chattis victoribus fortuna-in sa-

secundis minores fuissent.

‘marcentia poeula‘ (Stat. silv. 4. 6, believed to have planned out the suc-
56); more commonly ‘enfeebled’ (as cess which they really owed to luck.
in Η. 3. 36, a). Other causes, as 1n· Z. cites‘id illi in sapientiamcesserat,’
ternal sends (A. 11. 16, 1), and constant frema fragment of Sallust, and Tacitus
warfare with the Chatti (A. 12. 28, 2), has ‘cedere in solatium’ (H. 2. 59, 5),
had no doubt also weakened them. ‘gloriam' (A. 14. 54, 5).

inlacessiti, only here and in Agr. 5. tracti, ‘dragged in.' This al-
so, 3. temative ior ‘tacti’ is supported by
nutrierunt, ‘have indulged in.' ‘quae .. . ruina suatraxit’ (H. 3. ²9· 2),

1. inpotentes: cp. ‘impotentia’ and ‘Agrippinae pernicies. . . Plan-
(c. 35, 3). cinam traxit ' (A. 6. 26, 4).

falso quiescas, ‘it is vain to think
oi being at peace‘ They mnst at least,
like the Chauci (c. 35, 4), keep up a
strong defensive force.

a. nomina superioris (so nearly all
edd), ‘moderatiori and justice become
the titles of the stronger’ ; ie. what is
so styled in their conduct is despised as
folly and cowardice (cp. ‘inertes ac
stulti’) in the weak. The reading
‘nomina superiori,¹ adopted by Halm,
would give the meaning ‘are names
(aud nothing more) to the stronger’;
a sense somewhat supported by ‘nomen
exercitus¹ (H. 4. 15, 6), but less suit·
able to the context. Among other
suggestions are ‘ignominiae superiori‘
(Halm), and ‘nomina ignaviae (cp.
Sen. Ep. 45, 7) superiori’ (Mtiller).

3. olim, during their peaceiul life:
‘vocati sunt’ is supplied from ‘ vocan-

tur’ (cp. c. 2, 5).

Fosi, only here mentioned. It is
thought that they may have lived in
the district of Burgdorf, near the city
of Hanever, on the Fuhse, a small
tributary of the Aller.

6. ex aequo, ‘equally' (ἐξ ἴσον), so
in H. 2. 77, 3; 97, a, &a Other such
adverbial expressions with this prep.
are found, as ‘ex sacili' (Agr. 15, ις

7. minores, ‘in inferior position!

aside from the geographical order of

now returns to it. It has been thought
that he may have wished to bring to·

the most sormidable German enemies
of Rome, bnt he certainly here does
not speak of the former as such. He
