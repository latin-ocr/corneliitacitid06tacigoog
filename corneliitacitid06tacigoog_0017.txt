that prince, in an. 97, or immediately after his death in 98¹. He
was therefore either consul or a consular, and thus in the highest
senatorial rank, when he published this treatise‚ probably very shortly
after the publication of the Agricola.

PURPOSE OF THE TREATISE.

Much has been written on this subject ², but the conclusions reached
can never be fully satisfactory, as the internal evidence, aided by what
little is kno'wn of the circumstances of the time, is all that we have to
go upon.

The appearance of this work ahnost simultaneously with one so
different from it as the Agricola suggests the existence of some
motives common to both, and others peculiar to each treatise. As
regards the first kind, it must be borne in mind that Tacitus, however
eminent as a pleader and orator, was probably as· yet very little known
as awriter³, and altogether unknown. in the field of study to which
he had formed the intention of devoting himself. He¹ was already

ι engaged in the composition of a great work on his own times, which

ultimately appeared as his ‘Historiae ⁴,’ and might well have desired

· to prepare the way by something on a less ambitious scale, and to

win the interest of readers for his greater effort and for the political
ideas inspiring it.

He would also have been encouraged to the composition of
historical monographs by illustrious exampleS, especially by that
of Sallust, whom he is shown by frequent imitation throughout his
writings to have regarded as a model, and who had himself thus
combined a general historical work with special treatises on subjects
of peculiar interest. While he was feeling his way as a writer, Tacitus
would naturally be more disposed td imitate than afterwards, and as
