68 CORNELII T ACIT I DE GERMANIA

4. lineamenta BC, liniamentabc. caelorum C. imitentur c. 6. hyemi
BC, hiemi b c, text Reifferscheid. 7. locis all, text Acid.

1. materia, ‘timber’3 so in A. 1.
35, 1 (where see note); Caes. 4, 17, S,
&c ‘Zimmer’ (old German ‘Zimbar')
means both ‘chamber' and ‘timben’
Or. and others cite Herodian’s account
of German loghouse villages at the time
of Maximin. The beehive shaped,
thatched, windowless huts of the Mar-
comani and Quadi, represented on the
Antonine column (Bartoli, pl. 9, 65,
&c.)‚ though evidently conventional,
may correspond somewhat to the rudest
actual type, such as the huts of serfs.

2. informi, uncouthly fashioned.

citra, ‘falling short ol.' The word

· is here equivalent to ‘sine’ (cp. ‘citra

Romanum sanguinem bellanti ' Agr. 35,

2), and has often a similar force in silver

Latin. See Peterson on Dial. 27, a.
delectationem, ‘comfort’

3. quaedam loca, &c This state·
ment is very obscure, and would appear
as if Tacitus was describing something
which he imperfectly understood. Itis
not clear whether the colouring was on
the exterior or interior surfaces, but it is
most probable that' the ‘quaedam loca’
were certain porticus or chambers in-
side, and that these were plastered over
with coloured earth or earths of such
purity and brighmess as to correspond
in some sort to the Roman wall
decorations (such as are seen at Pompeii).
The ‘earth’ can hardly be (as some
think) mere white chalk, ,which could
hardly be said ‘imitari picturam,’ but is
probably some kind of ochre‚ and os
more than one colour, so arranged as to
approach in some sort to a design.
‘Imitari’ has the sense of substitution,
as inVerg. G. 3, 380, Aen. 11, 894,
&c., and ‘ picturam' is not ‘ a picture’
(in which sense ‘picturas‘ would
probably have been used) but ‘the art

ol painting‚’ and is explained by ‘ lini·
amenta colorum’ (·-·‘ iniamenta colo·

rata’). The whole may be translated
‘some parts they plaster carefully with
carth of such purity and brilliancy of
hue as to form a substitute for paint·
ing and designs in colour.’ None of
the emendations proposed (as ‘poli-

turam’ for ‘picturam ‘locorum‚' ‘cor-
porum,’ &c for‘colorum ') appear to
be necessary.

4. solent, probably not with the same
subject as ‘inlinunt,’ but rather ‘there
are some who’ &c., like ‘ gerunt’ (c. 17,
2). The ruder tribes os the north appear
to be meant.

5. specus. Pliny (19. 1, a, 9) speaks
of such not as dwellings but spiuning
places (‘ in Germania defossi atque snb
terra id opus agunt ’), and old laws give
evidence of such workplaces for women
still existing in the middle ages (see Ms.
cited by SS.), as well as storehouses.
Subterraneau dwellings for shelter in
winter are described among other
northern nations (cp. Verg. G. 3, 376),
similar to the pit dwellings of which
remains are found in England and else·
where, or to those of the present
Eskimanx.

insuper, either ‘overhead' (c. 12,1),
or‘besides’ (c. 31, 33 45, 1).

6. hiemis, so most recent edd. (cp.
arbitraturi, intrata
Κ.) in the sense os ‘hominibus hieme
vexatis' It is also possible that the
true text is ‘hieme'

7. looi, used not of localities (¹ loca')
but distinct spots, in A. 1. 61, 1, &c.,
also in Sall. and Liv.
