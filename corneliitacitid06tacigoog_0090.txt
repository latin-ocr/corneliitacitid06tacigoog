tion’ (between invited and uninvited):
cp. ‘notum ignotumquq' &a below.
This indiscriminateness of hospitality
is characteristic of ancient civilization‚
and grows ont of its circumstances:
without it, travelling would have been
impossible. It can be illustrated abun·
dantly from the Homeric poems, and
from many other sources, and has its
counterpart now in scantily peopled
countries, though in strong contrast to
modern society generally, or to the
Rome of Tacitus.

r. quantum ad, ‘ so far as concems’
(=‘qnantum attinet ad ’); so in Agr.
44, 33 H. 5. 10, 33 perhaps taken from
Ov. A. A. 1, 744 l‘quantum ad Piri-
thoum').

2. abeunti. Such gifts to the guest
on departure, and the asking for them

arcillustrated from the Nibelungenlied;
the old German name for them rs ‘letzi’
(SS.). Such ξεινηια are constantly men·
tioned in the Homeric poems.

moris: cp.c.13,1.

3. facilitas, ‘freedom from con·
straint’ : so ‘ facilis ’ is used in the sense
of ‘frank’ in Agr. 4ο, 4; Α. 3. 8, 4,
&e

gaudent, emphatic, asin c. 5, a.

4. imputant, ‘reckon as a favoun'
The givet expects no return, the receiver
feels uo obligation.

sentence could possibly be taken as sum-

for ‘comis’ make it a reminiscence of
the ⁴ victusque communicatur’ of Caes.
(see above). The ‘vinculum inter bos·
pites comitas¹ of Lachmann (which SS.
adopts) is somewhat violent and hardly
apposite; ‘victus inter honestiores co-
mites ' (Mr.) would give a meaning only
true in special cases, where a ‘comita-
tus’existed, and it is perhaps best to
regard the sentence as interpolated from
amarginal summary of the passage.

The preceding sentence seems to close κ

the subject.

6. quem plerumque, &c.‚ in con·
trast to the Romans who usually rose
before daybreak. ,

7. saepius calida. In view of other
statements (as Caes. 4.1, 10; 6. 21, ¹5:
Herodian, 7. a, 12) that the Germans'
bath was the river, and the abundant
evidence of their fondness for swimming
(A. a. 8. 3), it has been thought that
Tacitus is wrong; but his words may
well be true of the (laily ablutions of
most Germans during most part of the
year( (‘saepins'). For the use of‘ ut‚’

cp.cry 2 ·

plurimum, sc. ‘temporis' (c. 15, Ι).

8. separatae, &c This also is con·
trary to Roman custom. It has been
thought that the latter part of the state·
ment is an error arising from the use of
the same German words for a table and
a dish (cp. ‘Tisch ' from Latin ‘discus’);
but separate tables as well as separate
seats are found used by Greeks in early
times (Od. 17, 3333 aa, 74, δια).

9. convivia; besides public, there
were often family feasts to celebrate
births, marriages, &a
