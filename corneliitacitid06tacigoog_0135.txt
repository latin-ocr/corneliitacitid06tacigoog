1. opes, so Halm and Ζ., alterMeiser
(cp. c. 5, 2); perhaps more likely to
have been written than ⁸ spes,' as giving
a contrast to ‘paupertas' Other edd.
retain the MSS. text. With the Germans
arehery seems to have been a late intro·
duction, as ‘Pfeil' (arrow) is thought to
bea loen-word from ‘pilum' (Taylor,
Origin os Aryans, p. 151).

inopia ferri: cp. c. 45, 3.

asperent, properly ‘sharpen’ (cp.
pugionem. . .asperari iussit, A. 15.
54, 1) here ‘make points for! Bone
arrow-heads were used in the time os
Pausanias (An. 21, 5) by Sarmatiam,
and are stated to be even now in use
in Lapland and in parts of Siberis.

2. comitantur, sc. ‘feminae viros.‘
The extreme form of the hunter’s life
is that in which women hunt as well as
men.

3. petunt, ‘claim sor themselves’

64. suffugium: ior the genit. cp. cl

aisquoramorumnexu. Laplanders
are described as living still in hovels‚
made of four boughs bent together and
held in place by twisted twigs and
covered with some sort of canvas; and
such a mode of life is described by Hdt.
(4. 23, 6), bnt with some distinction
between summer and winter dwellings,
which Tacitus here ignores.

5. redeunt, i.e. from hunting.

receptaculum, ¹ their retuge’ when
they can hunt no more.

beatiusarbitrantur,&c. The ascrip·
tion of a philosoplrical view os lise to

such people is to be noted as a flourish
of rhetoric.

6. ingemere agris (dat.) ; ,imitated
from ‘bidenti’ ‘aratro ingemere' (Lucr.
5, 2093 Verg. G. 1, 45).

inlaborare domibus. This verb is
ἅπ. εῖρ. and evidently coined to answer
to ‘ingemere’ It would seem there-
fore that it must take the same con·
struction, 'and that the phrase must
mean ‘toil over house building,’ in
contrast to their rude shelter above
described. K. takes it to mean ‘labour
indoors,' thinking that Tacitus means
to describe the three leading forms
oi civilized industrial lile, that os
the agriculturist, the artisan, and the
trader.

7. versare, ‘ to traffie with their own
and others' fortunes under hope and
sear ' 3 as do all traders.

securi, &c.‚ ‘having nothing to tear
at the hands of men or gods‚' i. e. having
nothing to excite the ‘ invidia' ol either,
nothing (except life) os which they
could be deprived.

9. ne voto quidem opus esset, they
have nothing to pray sor or long for,
have neither a longing nor even the idea
osone.

eatena iam fabulosa, ‘all from this
point is fabulous!

10. Hellusios, nowhere else men·
tioned, and taken by Mt. to mean
‘giants’ A people oi somewhat simi·
