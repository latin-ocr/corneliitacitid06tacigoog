1. Retro, i.e. to the east and north· sense, regarding these peoples as con·
east. The iorest and mountain tract fronting the Roman empire.
which all these tribes are stated to 3. cultu, ‘mode oi life,' as in
have occupied is that between Bohemia c. 46, 1.

and Silesia (the Riesengebirge), and the
watershed between the Oder and some
northern tributaries oi the Danube, as
the Waag and Gran.

Marsigni. The first part oi the
name is that oi the Marsi (see c. 2, 4,
and note). T he termination (cp. lieu-
digni, c. 40, 1) may denote some kind
os eminence in that stock.

Cotini, so read by all recent edd,
with Dio, 71. 12, 3; the MSS. text
‘Gotini' being apparently a confusion
os this Celtic tribe with the Goths (c.
44, 1). Caesar mentions (6. 24, 2)
a Gallie tribe (Volcae Tectosages) on
the horder oi the Hercynian forest, but
there is no evidence connecting them
with this people.

Osi; on these cp. c. 28, 3. Tacitus
here speaks os their language as Pan·
nonian, which shows them to be an
illyrian race, specially related (see l. l.)
to the Aravisci. The lllyrian lan·
guage, known only through the Alba·
nian (cp. c. 1, 1), is considered to have
affinities to Greek and Iranian (see
Taylor, Origin os Aryans, p. 268).

, Buri, mentioned again in the time
of Trajan and M. Aurelius (Dio, 68.
8, 1, 71. 18). Ptol. (a. 11, 20) calls
them a branch oi the Lugians (see
below), and places them at the source
oi the Vistula.

terga . . . claudunt, in a military

Suebos. More properly they seem
to belong to the Vandilii of c. a, 4.

resonant: cp. c. 20, 3.

4. st quod . . . patiuntur, ‘ and the
fact tha't they submit to,' co-ordinated
with ‘lingua’ as the subject oi ‘arguit'

5. partem i.e. the one (probably
the Osi) were tributary to the Sarmatae
(the Iazyges noted on c. 1, 1), the other,
probably the Cotini, to the Quadi.

6. quo magis pudeat, ie. because
they have the material ready to hand
which should make arms to win their
sreedom, and which was scarce in Ger-
many (c. 6, 1). Iron mines in the part
of the Hercynian mountains near the
Quadi (ie. near Crakow) were known
to Ptol. (a. 11, 26).

7. cetorum, ‘but especially’: cp.
A. 12. 59, a.

8. montiumiugumquo: some omit
or bracket the latter word, others both,
as a repetition from the line below, or
as glosses. If both are retained, ‘iu-
gum' may be explained hythe follow·
ing ‘continuum iugum’ (on which see
on § 1), as the ridge, distinguished from
certain summits.

9. ultraquod. The locality oi these
tribes would be in Silesia and Poland,
between the Oder and Vistula.

10. agunt: cp. c. 29, 3.

Lugiorum: this reading is defended
from Strab. and Ptol. (Aobytot). Dio
