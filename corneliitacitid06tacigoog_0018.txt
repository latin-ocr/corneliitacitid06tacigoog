PURPOSE OF THE TREATISE 5

the ‘Dialogus’ represents his Ciceronian, we might say that the
Germania and Agricola represent his Sallustian period ; the influence Δ
of that writer being traced in the plan of the latter work ¹, and
perhaps as a source of material in the former ², as well as in the style
and language of both ³.

When it is asked‚ what particular reasons may have led Tacitus to
choose this particular subject lor such separate treatment, the explana·
tion is naturally sought in those parts of the treatise which show most
evidence of being written with a purpose: hence some have supposed, ,
from the descriptions of German hardihood and courage, and of the
disasters which Rome had suffered at their hands ⁴, that he desired to
turn men's thoughts from any idea os subjugating them ; others, that
he intended to lash the vices of effete civilization by contrast with the
virtues ol healthy barbarism⁶3 such explanations being plainly too
partial to account for the treatise as a whole, which we cannot suppose
to have been written for the mere purpose of bringing in a few
telling passages

The abrupt beginning and ending ol the work have suggested the ¹
idea that it was written for insertion in the Histories⁶‚ and was for
some reason afterwards taken out and published separately. The ·
‘situs gentium’ is certainly reckoned by Tacitus among the proper
subjecte oi history⁷; and we have evidence of his practice in the
account of Britain in the Agricola⁸ and of the Jews in the Histories ⁰, as
well as ol that of other writers ¹⁰. Itis ol course impossible to suppose
that such an excursus could have been intended to extend to anything
like the length os the present treatise: it is nevertheless possible that,
while on the one hand he may have come to think that he was writing
on no such era in the relations os Rome and Germany as to warrant
more than avery briei preparatory sketch, on the other, the richness of
material, the interest ol the subject, the consciousness that he could
correct and improve upon the work of his predecessors, may have led
