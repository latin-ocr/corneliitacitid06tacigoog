1. quodfemina dominatur. This

founded on the fact that these Finns
distinguished themselves from the high-
land Lapps as ‘kainulaiset’ (a Finnish
word for ‘Lowlander’), in which was
thought to lie a root of the Gothic
‘quino' or ‘quens' English ‘queau'
(γυνή), whence arose legends of a
‘evena land' or ‘terra feminarum’ in
the north, like the tales of Scythic
Amazons.

Some would transpose these words, as
well as the preceding, to the end os c.
44, but they seem required here to point
the coutrast to the names which follow.

Peucinorum. These took their
· name from an island belonging to the
delta of the Danube. They are identified
by Tacitus with the Bastarnae (see
beltilw), but cremore properly a division
oft em.

venedorum. Some retain ‘Vene-
torum‚’ thinking that Tacitus may have
confused the name with that of the
Gallie (Caes. 3. 8, 1) or Adriatic (Polyb.
217, 5) Veneti. The right name is
clearly ‘ Venedae,’ or ‘ Venedi’ (Plin. 4
13, 27, 97; Ptol. 3. 5, 19), answering
to the ‘Wiuidae‘ ol lomandes. Ptol.
also gives their name to some moun·
tains and a gulf not easy to identisy.

of that race known to Romans only
through German information, aud then
probably living from the east of the
Vistula to the sources of the Bory-
sthenes, in and round Poland.

4. Fennorum. These are mentioned
by no earlier writer, aud are the Φίννοι
of Ptol. 3. 5, 20, the F inus of the main·

land north os the Aestii, extending from ι

the Baltic to the Ural mountains. The
name again is German, not national
(derived by Zeuss from the Gothic
‘fani' ‘fen,’ by Mf. from ‘finna’=
‘pinna' in reference to their use of
snowsboes). Itis thought that these
Fenni correspond more in description
to the Lapps (see notes below) ; the true
Finns being the Sitones of c. 45, 9.

Sarmatis, not here used with the

northwards. The Sarmaticus os this
tract must have been at least in great
part Slavoniau (see Introd. p.15, note 6).

5. quamquam, qualifying the doubt
as regards the first named.

Bastarnas, a widespread name
with many subdivisions (Strab. 7. 3, 15,
305 foll.) extending from the sources of
the Vistula to the mouth of the Danube,
and forming one of Pliny's five generic
names (see on c. 2, 3). They are gener·
ally reckoned as true Germuns, and as
the first os the racc mentioned in
history, having been invited by Philip
of Macedon to aid him against the
Romans in tac. 179 (Liv. 40. 57).

somewhat known to Romans; of that
