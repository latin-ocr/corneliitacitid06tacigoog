PURPOSE OF THE TREATISE 7

heroic courage of its people, and thc blows which they had inflicted
on Rome during more than two hundred years without any substantial
conquest of their territory ¹, so as to force him to own, in words that
at the end of another century must have seemed prophetie, that only
the internal discords of the race could avert the destiny which was
hurrying the Roman empire to its destruction ².

This ethieal and political purpose, however insufficient to explain

ἢ vthe treatise asa whole, has powerfully influenced the treatment of ι

considerable portions⁸. In exhibiting to his readers the great free
people who alone among the nations had ever cast off the yoke once
laid upon thern, and caused a distinctflrecess'ion of the Roman frontier,
he would naturally use all his skill to idealize the vigorous and manly
qualities standing in the sharpest contrast to the enfeebling luxury
and vicious degradation of Roman contemporary life.. Such con-

ι trasts for literary effect are especially sought by Tacitus throughout

his writings⁴, and have often formed part of the common stock of

orators and poets, and such an idea had been already touched by ·

Horace⁵ in language showing a sufficiently close resemblance to the
thought of· Tacitus to suggest some common source of both of them ⁶.

‘Campestres melius Scythae, '
Quorum plaustra vagas rite trahunt domos,
Vivunt, et rigidi Getae,
Immetata quibus iugera liberas
F iuges et Cererem ferunt,
Nec cultura placet longior annua,
Defunctumque laboribus
Aequali recreat sorte vicarius.
Illic matre carentibus
Privignis mulier temperat innocens,
Nec dotata regit virum
Coniux nec nitido fidit adultero.
Dos est magna parentium
Virtus, et metuens alterius viri
Certo foedere castitas;
Et peccare nefas aut pretium est mori.¹
