THE ACCOUNT GIVEN Bll TACITUS 17

determining the ethnology of the Venedi 3ηά Fenni he has no test of
language to apply, and is only able to speak of their mode of life and
customs¹.

Another universal characteristic of the Germans on which he lays
stress, that of their physical appearance ², leads to a difficulty of which
we should think that he ought himself to have been aware3 for the
peculiarities on which he insists, the ruddy hair, flashing blue eyes,
stalwart limbs, and others, agree equally with all Roman description of
the Gauls ³, and it would seem that on this point, as well as in several
of their other qualities ⁴, no clear distinction between the races was
noticed by Greeks or Romans, and that it was long before they
were marked off at all. To Greeks at an earlier date all the north-west ,
of Europe was peopled by Κελτοί or rahdratl: nor does Cicero distin-
guish the nationality of the Teutons and Cimbri from that of those
who had once pillaged Rome under Brennus ⁶. Caesar, the first to
distinguish clearly between Gauls and Germans‚ rests his distinction
not on physique‚ but on differences of religion a'nd customs⁷ ; 3ηά
Strabo, writing about nn. 10—20, is aware of no stronger physical
difference than that the German is an exaggerated Celt ⁸. lt should
be remembered that by the time of Tacitus the Gauls had been so
greatly changed and enervated bya century and a half of subjection
as to be no longer liable to be confounded in respect of warlike spirit
and qualities⁹, and perhaps less so than formerly even in physical
appearance¹⁰, with the fierce and unchanged Germans.
