the admission to his ‘ comitatus? Many
have notedthe resemblancetomediaeval
knighthood.

1. haec . . noga (sc. ‘virilis '). Taci-
tus is contrasting this public act (cp. ‘iu
ipso concilio’ above) with the Roman
private ceremonies 01 the ‘tirocinium’
which, however, was accompanied by a
‘deductio in forum’

1. honos, ‘gift ofhonour,' cp. c. 15, 1.

ante hoc, &c.: it was in fact an
act of emancipation ‘ e manu patris,’ but
probably the full rights of a freeman
were confined to landholders. The Ro-
man ‘toga 'virilis’ gave no emancipation.

3. insignia nobilitas, &c The
reading and interpretation 01 this pas-
sage are much disputed. As regards
this sentence, ‘dignitatem’ has good

, MS. authority, but ‘dignationem' is
very generally read. The latter word
has always elsewhere in Tacitus, and
also in most other authors, much the
same force as the former, and denotes
a person's rank or position, or the con·
sideratiou in which he is held: cp. c.
16, 1; ‘inponere imperatoris digna·
tionem ’ (H. 1. 52, 7), &c The mean·
ing would thus he ‘distinguished rank
or great services of parents award to
some even as striplings (stronger than
‘iuvenem'above)thepositionofaprince’
(cp. ‘imperium adsignabunt,’ H. 1. 30,
7). The difficulty of connecting the
sentence thus interpreted with the fol-
lowing words (see note below), added
to that ofsupposing that ‘adolescentuli'
could become ‘principes' in any such
sense as that given above (ξ 1), has led
others to take ‘principis dignationem’
to mean ‘the esteem, or approval of
a pn'nce,’ i. e. that on such grounds a
prince sometimes seleets even striplings,
whom he himself invests with arms (see
above), and whom he at once eurols
among his ‘comites’ This sense of
‘dignatio,’though otherwise foreign to
TacituS, seems borne out by such pas·

sages as ‘tanta dignatione dilexit' (Suet.
Cal. 24), ‘in summa dignatione regis
vixit'(Just. 3. 28, 10), and certainly
makes the whole passage much clearer, .
though we should perhaps expect some
other verb than ‘ adsignant,' in the sense
01 ‘ bespeak.’

4. ceteris, &c. With the interpre-
tation preferred above, this would
mean that those whom the ‘princeps'
honours even 11 striplings with admis-
sion to his ‘comitatus, are grouped
with the older members of it, and are
not ashamed, in spite of their high pa·
rentage, to serve in its rank and file.
Those who take the other interpretation
of ‘ principis dignationem ' would either
explain these words as meaning that
the ‘adolescentuli' though already
ranked as ‘principes' are not at once
actual leaders, but serve for a time in
the ranks (a meaning hard to get out
of the words), or would (as Halm, Mn,
Pramm. and others) adopt Lipsius‘
reading ‘ ceteri,’ with the meaning that
those ‘tirones’ who were not so ex·
ceptionally ranked as ‘principes’ ‘are
grouped with riper and tried warriors.¹
join themselves to the ‘comitatus’ of
some chief. But we should rather sup·
pose that those invested with arms by
the parent 01 guardian were enrolled in
the ‘cuneus' of the family or clau (c.
7, 3). Several other alterations 01 the
text have been suggested.

5. nec rubor: ‘necrubori,’ poet. for
‘nec dedecus’: cp. ‘nec‘ruborestemisse’
(Ov. A. A. 3, 167), and Petersou’s note .
on Dial. 37, 1. This sentence supports
the reading ‘ceteris‚’ as it would most
naturally refer to persons of high birth.
lf ‘ceteri' be read, there would be here
no special reference to the ‘ adolescen-
tuli,' but a general remark, with an im-
plied contrast to the position of a client
at Rome, so often described as humiliat·
ing. The subject 01 the ‘comitatus’
extends to the end of c. 14.
