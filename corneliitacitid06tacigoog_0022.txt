LANGUAGE AND ST llLE 9

discarded Ciceronian rotundity‚ and required its speakers to be terse,
epigrammatic‚ and striking ¹, tolerant of Graecisms 2, and enriching
their phraseology from the treasury of classical poetry or by original
inventions of their own.

Of the practice os seeking effect by novelty of diction we have
such instances as ‘eiectamenta' (c. 45, 5), ‘improcerus' (c. 5, 1,
‘inlaborare' (c. 46, 5), ‘inlacessitus' (c. 36, 1, also in Aghffdl
bably ‘praetracto' (Qand some words apparently here first
used in prose, as ‘feralis’ (c. 43, 6), ‘inexhaustus' (2. ffl-and in
Hist.), ‘monstrator’ (csta), &c., but we have not yet such archaic
revivals as ‘claritudo' and ‘necessitudo' substituted for the Ciceronian
‘claritas' (c. 34, 2) and ‘necessitas’ (c. 1 2 nor does he as yet
'prefer ‘cupido’ to ‘cupiditas'(c.·1.2,2; 35, 3), nor ‘dum ’ to ‘dum-
modo' (ej-Q). The poetical use, so frequent in the Annals, of
simple verbs for compound, is here sparing: there are isolated in·
stances (lor example) of ‘ clarescere' (affl, also in Dial), ‘cludere’
· (c. 45, 6), ‘firmare’ (e. 39, ι), ‘monstratus' (c. 31, 4), ‘vocare’

(οὔ-ὼ on the other hand we have ‘adsuescere' Quot

‘suescere‚' ‘evalescerc' (c. 28, 1), not ‘valescere,' an the verbal
substantive ‘apparatus' Q 23, ι), not ‘paratus⁸.'

In the diction as awhole we have not the same general straining
after compression which becomes afterwards so characteristic of him,
though we are not without signal examples of it. It would be hard
to find even in his latest works expressions so harsh from their brevity

as ‘vallare noctem' (c. 3ο, 2), to say less of ‘nonin alia vilitate’
(c. 5, 4), ‘virgines festinantur' (Q, ‘ius parendi' (c. 44, 3),
‘regia utilitas’ (2. 44, 4), ‘frumenta laborare' (c. 45, 4), &c We have
again, though sparingly, some ol his favourite ellipses, as of ‘ sit’ or
‘sint' (Q dcc), ol ‘ magis' Q, ol ‘non solum’ belore ‘sed
et'(c. 17, 3; 45, 4: in c. 35, 2 the full expression is used), or of
‘et' orfetffin ' after the former (c. 10, 5), or os similar words c. 10 ι).
Το set against these, it may behot‘ed among syntactical usages that
we have berea solitary and not strong instance ol the concise expres-
sion of purpose by the gerundive dative (while the still more

and ‘conferre armentorum aut frugum’ absent is also common. ‘Paratus' is
(c. 15, 2), also the Greek expression used once in Agr. (25, 3).
