To set against these, there are points in which the Germans had
reached a considerably higher stage. The sense of liberty and ,

personal dignity‚ by no means prominent in the Homeric δῆμος ¹, is
here lullydeveloped: the German comesto assemblies as and when
he pleaseS, is nnmistakably free to disapprove as well as to approve‚
and has rather to be persuaded than coereed ⁴, and the king is hardly
more prominent in it than others whose position or achievements
entitle them to be heard.

On the German king we would gladly have heard more lrom
Tacitus ⁵. We gather that he was chosen, bnt only from the noblest
lineage ⁶, the ‘stirps regia ⁷‚' generally represented as of divine descent,
in the lull sense διογενής. But, however approaehing to a despotic
monarch in the most remote and backward tribes ⁸, he has elsewhere

more dignity than power. It is even doubtful whether he is necessarily ’

the leader in war ¹, and certainly the supreme coercive authority both
in the field and in the assembly belongs not to him but to the priest ¹⁰.
He has a faint survival ol primitive priestly function in augnry ¹¹, he
has a share of lines ¹¹, and probably of other presents¹³‚ but does not
appoint judges or magistrates ¹⁴, and generally reigns rather than
governs; while any such royalty as that ol Maroboduus, embracing
many tribes, and almost confronting the Caesar as an equal, was
· most abnormal and obnoxious to the sentiment of independence ¹¹.
Again, even such limited kingly rule, though prevalent among the
Suebic Germans¹¹‚ is represented as generally dispensed with among ·
the western and more advanced tribes ¹¹, and replaced by the rule ol
an elected magistrate ¹⁸, or probably in more cases by no other central
