after his time.

supplied from the sense.

way os the world.

melius, sc. ‘agunt ’: verbs os motion
or action, as well as of speaking, are
osten omitted by Tacitus. Cp. Agr.
19, 23 ‘vos quidem istud pro me' (H.
1. 84, ι) ‘melius . . . ille' (A. 1. 43, 1),

was expected to hang herself, or to burn
on the husband’s pile, like the Indian
Suttee, and that the marriage of widows,
even where not forbidden, was thought
dishonourable. This is, os course, a
still stronger contrast to Roman custom.

5. sps votoque, ‘ the hope and as-
piration’ of married lil .

7. ultra, beyond one marriage.

ne tamquam, &c., ‘that her love

should love her husband not merely as
a man, but rather as elevating her to
the permanent dignity of a matron.
‘Tamquam' has coustantly iu Tacitus
the force os ὡς, here rather that of ὡς
εἰπεῖν, as qualisying a strong statement.
Meiser would read ‘tam maritum quam,'
others omit the second ‘tamquam‘

8. numerum . . . finire, ‘to prevent
an increase’ (Juv. 6, 595).

9. adgnatise ἐπιγόνοις, children born
aiter there is already an heir: so in H.
5. 5, 5, where a similar prohibition
among the Jews is mentioued. Tacitus
appears here to overstrain the contrast;
sor it can be shown that the German
father sometimes exercised power to
hill, expose, or sell (cp. A. 4. 72, 4)
his children. But no doubt the expo·
sure of infants was much rarer than at
Rome, perhaps especially rare among

the best-known tribes, aud¹ is not sor-

bidden, contrary to sentiment.

10. morea. . . legas, so opposed in
Hor. Od. 3. 24, 35. The German sane-
tity os custom is contrasted with the
futility oi such laws as the ‘ lex Pa ia
Poppaea' at Rome (see A. 3. 26, 1, soih).
No written German laws appear to be
certainly traceable earlier than the Salio
of the fifth century.
