18 INTRODUCYION

In the representation of the character and institutions oi the people‚
we have a picture ol a racc of Aryan speech and institutions at a stage
ol development on the whole peculiar to itsell¹. The resemblance
that will chiefly strike classical students is that to the Greeks of the
Homeric age ². Like these, they constantly bear arms in daily life ³,
they show hospitality to the stranger no less than to friends ⁴, they
reekon value in oxen or other animals ⁶, they get their wives by a kind
of purchase ⁶, blood vengeance and its atonement by a ποινή are
recognized institutions⁷, the kings are honoured by quasi-voluntary
gilts⁸, the submission ol great questions, such as war and peace, to
a general assembly ol the people‚ after previous discussion by the
chiefsl, reminds us of the Homeric βουλὴ and ἀγορή ¹⁰, and the
tumultuous spear·clashing by which approval was indicated ¹¹, is but
a variation from the Achaean shout ¹².

On the other hand we notice no less striking and instructive
differences ln some respects‚ especially as regards the arts and
appliances ol life, the Germans are at a far lower stage, as we should
expect in a race remote from the Mediterranean‚ compared with those
who had long known Phoenician intercourse. Thus, although they
were living in an age not os bronze but imn, metal of all kinds is

scarce with Germans, the iron-tipped ‘framea' is the only universal .
weapon, the shield is of mere painted boards‚ the sword and massy
spear and corslet are rare, the helmet in any form almost unknown ¹³,
a great contrast in all points to the Homeric panoplies. Again‚ even
the Homeric ship must have been some stages removed from the
northern sail-less boats ¹⁴, and a house lar less splendid than the
