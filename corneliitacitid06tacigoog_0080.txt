6. longant B and prob. bl, text b² (margin), 810.

1. electi, better than their own
usually were (c. 6, 3).

magna arma. Some would read
‘magnifica’ or even ‘insignia' ; but it is
easy to take it 10 mean massive shields
and cuirasses‚ suitable to their stature,
possibly also huge offensive weapons,
as spears and swords.

phalerae . . . torques. These em·
bossed plates 01 discs and collars are
often mentioned as military decoraticns
01 Roman soldiers (Juv. 16, 60, &c.).

iam 01 . , . docuimus, ‘we have now
even taught them' (cp. c. 42, 1), as
a lesson 01 Roman avarice.

pecuniam. He is not here speaking
01 trade, as in c. 5, 5, but 01 bribes 10
princes in Roman interest, as spoken 01
111 0 42, 2; A. 11.16,3: cp. ‘pecuniam
et dona, quis solis cormmpantur' (H.
4. 76, 3). It has been thought that
some such action on the part 01
Domitian may be here alluded to.

3. populis, dat. 01 agent, as in 0. 31,
1, &c

urbes: see Introd. p. 24.

4. colunt, &e It is generally sup-
posed that Tacitus means in this

villages, the dependent (c. 25, 1 aud
note) and the free (e. 16, 1 and note),
and it is possible that what he speaks 01
first is in 1101 the former, bnt that the
house 01 11101011, built where he chose,
is alone mentioned (the 11111101 the serfs
being sufficiently insignificant to be
ignored), ancl that he then goes on 10

speak 01 the more important 01 1100
villages, which alone he would probably
reckon as ‘ vici! It would seem that all
houses belonged in some sense to ‘vici'
as centres 01 justice (c. 12, 3).

discreti ac diversi, ‘separated and
in various places’: cp. ‘si . .. diversi
inrupissent' (H. 3. 46, 3).

5. ut fons, 810. SS. notices the
frequency in German names 01 such
terminatione as ‘brunnen‚’ ‘ feld‚' ⁴ berg‚'
‘wald‚’&c

vicos locant, ‘they lay out their
villages.’ The description here given
would mark a social stage far above
that 01 Caesar's time, who makes the
Germans (6. 11, 1) have no lixed
dwellings at all (see 0110. 16, 1). The
account 01 Caesar was perhaps even
then true only 01 some tribes 01 more
wandering life. 'He is thought to have
known most 01 the Suebi (see on 0. 38,
1), whom he describes separately (4.
1-4).

7. spatio, ‘a homestead,' garden,
χορτός, ‘ hortus,' surrounded by a fenee.

8. remedium, 111 apposition with the
sentence.

inscitia (causal abl), so with
genit. in Agr. 28,4, 810. A sar more
probable reason than either 01 these is
to be found in the German love 01
independence. From these words he is
led to speak 01 their mode 01 building.

caementorum. .. tegularum. This
is confirmed by the absence 01 genuine
German names 101 these and the use 01
words 01 Latin origin, as ‘ cement' and
‘tile' <⁸ Ziegel'). The primitive 1001
would be 01 straw or rushes, as was that
01 the Gauls (Caes 5. 43, 1). ‘Cae-
menta,' rough stone (opp. lo ⁶ materia ’).
