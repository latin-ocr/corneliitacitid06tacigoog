At Rome the divination might be re-
peated ‘ad libitum!

in eundem diem, sc. ‘spectans'

1. auspiciorum, &c., ‘the confirma-
tion (cp. ‘dictis fides exstitit‚’ Liv. 10.
34,14) os auspices is yet further (cp.
c· 19, 3; 29, 3) demanded' (0- 14, 4)·

2. etiam hio notum, generally taken
to mean ‘is also known in Rome,' in
contrast to ‘proprium gentis’; but as
Tacitus would hardly state so obvious
a fact, it is probable that ‘hic’ means ,
‘in Germauy,’ and is used (as in c. 3, 3)
because ‘illud' had immediately pre·
ceded. The antithesis in thought would
still remain: ‘it is known among them
also how to divine from birds; but their
distinctive practice is‚’ &c

voees volatusque, ‘their note, and
the direction os their night?

3. proprium gentis. It was a pa·
rently also known to Aryauspeaking
peoples in the east; as Hdt. describes
similar sacred white horses among the
Persians (1.189,1; 7. 40, 5), and an
augury from neighing (3. 86, 1).

4. isdem, those mentioned above
⁴ (c. 9, 3) ; local abl. as ‘isdem castris’
(Agr. 25,1), ‘isdem hibemis' (H. 1.
55, 3), aud many other analogous ex·
pressions‚ mainly derived irom poets.

5. et nullo, rather stronger than
‘neque ullo’: cp. c. 20, 5; 28,1,&c.

mortali, ‘human': cp. c. 21, 23

' Agr. 11, 1,&c.

contacti, ‘defiled'; so ‘nullis con·
tacta vitiis pectora’ (Dial. 12, 2).

pressos, ‘yoked'; so (with ‘iugo ’)
in Ovid (Met. 1, 1243 12, 77, &ck

6. princeps civitatis. This expres-
sion, like ‘sacerdos civitatis' above,
seems not merely equivalent to ‘princi-
pum aliquis,' but to denote some oue

person answering to the king iu king·
less states, as also a ‘princeps Chatto-
rum’ (see uote on Introd. p. 19) seems
spoken oi as ii he was one, and not Α
merely one oi mauy; but the authority
ol Caesar, borne out by much later evi-
dence also (see onintrod. p. 20, note 1),
would go to show that many such
states had no single ruler in peace time.
It has been thought that the ‘princeps'
of the most prominent ‘pagus’ had
some preeminence; it is possible also
that iu many states constant war with
Rome, or the sear oi it, had made the
‘dux’ (c. 7, 1) more permaneam pos·
sibly also, iu states normally under
kings, where no fit person oi such com·
manding lineage as to deserve the title
(see c. 7, 1) existed, a ‘Fiirst¹ was
sometimes chosen instead from some
wider area, differing from him in little
but title. We have again ‘rex vel

ruler ol the state in c. 5,4; 15, 2 ; 22, 3.

hinnitusque, &c.: probably it was
a good omen is they neighed‚ and a bad
one if they did not.

8. sed, inserted by most edd, as Taci-
tus, though he often, after ‘non solum ’ or
‘non modo,' omits either ‘sed' (Α. 3.
19, 2, dcc.) or ‘etiam’ (Α. 1. 60, 1, &c.),
never elsewhere omits both. 11, how·
ever, the reading ‘apud sacerdotes’ be
retained, the emphatic climax makes
the omission rnore tolerable.

proceres, probably a wider term
than ‘principes'x see Introd. p. 20,
note 5.
