vi ’ PREFAcE

Ι have therefore ventured to hope that, by striking
a balance between the meagreness of a schoolbook
and the fulness os an exhaustive edition, Ι may have
best consulted the requirements of most English
readers. These, while desiring to study this remark-
able treatise in the light of the principal results of
recent criticism, may probably not care to enter fully
into what is still, and is likely always to continue to
be, obscure and doubtful, or to have more than a very ³
concise treatment of difficulties, coupled with some
indication of works in which those who desire further
discussion may find it.

The text adopted is generally that os Halm, but
differs from it in a few places for reasons given in
each case.¹ The critical notes will be found to contain
the more important variations os the principal MSS.
and the source of the text adopted, where it differs

, from them; but such further discussion as can be

given of conjectural emendations will be found in the
explanatory notes. The most complete and accurate
collation known to meos the four leading MSS. is
that of Karl Muellenhoff (Berlin, 1873), and where,
as is not unfrequently the case, editors vary in their
citation os these MSS, Ι have generally* thought it
best to follow him. Three other MSS, preserved iri
Germany, are cited from the collation of Alfred
Holder (Leipzig, 1878).

In the Introduction and commentary Ι have been
