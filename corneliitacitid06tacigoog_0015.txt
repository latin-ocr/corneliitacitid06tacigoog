appear to have used abbreviations characteristic of the thirteenth
century. lt contained also the ‘Dialogus’ and the short treatise
of Suetonius ‘de Grammaticis et Rhetoribus,’ and is taken to be
the parent of all the existing MSS. Of these, the four most cited
by editors of the Germania are ranked in two families, derived from
two lost copies which may be designated as X and Y ¹.

Those of the X family are :—
1. B. Vaticanus 1862 ².

2. b. ‘Leidensis' (see above) now at Leyden, also called ‘Pon-
tanus,’ and (from its first known possessor) ‘Perizonianus,'
but now found to be not the actual copy taken by Fontanus,
but one from it by Geelius. 0

To the other, or Y family, belong :—

3. C. Vaticanus 1518.

4. c. Farnesianus or Neapolitanus, now at Naplcs to which
Lipsius, and afterwards Niebuhr, attached great importance‚
but which is now less valued.

Closelyallied to these two is another Vatican MS. (4498), designated
as A, the readings of which are sometimes, but very rarely noted ³.

Neither of these families has uniformly a better text than the
other, and both have had their advocates, but B, b are generally to
be ranked highest. lt should also be noted that other MSS. pre·
served in Germany have been by some reckoned to be of primary
importance‚ namely one (now lost) called ‘Hummelianus' (H), and
two others at Munich and Stuttgart (M and S), all of which are
maintained to be derived from copies taken of the old MS. before it
came into the possession of Asculanus⁴.

It is at any rate evident that the corruption or illegibility of the
old MS. itself must have been great, and that the text isin aless
satisfactory state than that of the Annals or the Histories
