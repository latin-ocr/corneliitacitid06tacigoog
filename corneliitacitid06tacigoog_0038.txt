chooses her own,' and the solemn investiture with arms as it were
emancipates the youth from paternal rule and dedicares him to the
vservice of the State ². Henceforth war becomes the freeman’s chief
and proper work; but even in war the family and local hond still
asserts itself. Each ‘ pagus' furnishes a company of the select foot
whose agility keeps pace with the mounted warriors in the van ³,
- while these horsemen themselves and the whole wedge·like phalanx
of the mass behind are grouped by families and clansmen standing
shoulder to shoulder ⁴: and even their women accompany the warriors

upbraid the yielding ⁶.

In connexion with their warfare stood another institution ⁰, noticed
by Tacitus as already in full force ⁷, and destined afterwards to affect
the framework not only of German but of European society, the*
enrolment of young men in the ‘comitatus' of a chief or ‘princeps’
The privilege of keeping such a body may be supposed to have
extended to all who borethis title ⁸, but in practice it must manifestly
have belonged to those only whose wealth and possessions gave them
the means ¹of supporting it, and most of all to the king or leader of
the state ⁹, who certainly could alone give a public status to his
followerS, while enrolment in its ranks, besides being sought for by
many as an honour, must have become the natural refuge of the
needy of all ranks and stations ¹⁰. We have thus already the germ
of a state withina state, and the growth of a body of vassals wholly
dependent on their lord ¹¹, living at his table, armed and enriched by
