The reckoning of time in c. 37, 2 would show the work to have
been completed in nn. 98, the first year of Trajan's principate ¹.

Tacitus was born, apparently of an equestrian family, probably not
earlier than A. o. 50 nor later than a. o. 55 ¹. He was brought up to
the forensic profession, was admitted in youth to the society of the
great orators and men of letters of the time,³, and was probably
a pupil of Quintilian. ln Α. o. 77 or 78 he was married to the
daughter of Cn. Julius Agricola ⁴, and at about the same date he
began his public career, receiving successive steps of promotion by
the direct favour of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian ¹, under the latter
of whom he had become praetor and ‘quindecimvir sacris faciendis'
ln n. n. 88 ⁰. Up to this date his life had been spent in Rome, where
we find from his friend the younger Pliny'¹ that he had reached an
extremely high position among the orators of the day and was one
of the leaders of the Roman bar. Soon after his praetorship he left
Rome for four years⁸ (no. 89-93, or 90-94), and was thus absent ’
at the death of his father-iu-law Agricola. His absence must have
been due to the tenure of some provincial appointment, such as
a senator of praetorian rank could hold. It has been thought that
he· may have been governor (legatus Augusti propraetore) of Gallia
Belgica ¹, and may thus have acquired some personal knowledge of
the nearer Germans¹⁰. On his return to Rome he lived in evil times,
and must have been so far unacceptable to Domitian that he received
no further favour, though he appears to have avoided imperilling
himself by active opposition ¹¹. To Nerva he was indebted for the
