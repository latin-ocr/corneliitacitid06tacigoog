a substantive work, and enlarge it to its present dimensions.
³ Nor are we wholly without grounds of conjecture as to his possible
reasons for working it up to completion and publishing it at this parti·
cular time. The whole subject had acquired a recent interest from
the wars of Domitian, and the elevation of Trajan rothe principale
found him occupied with the charge of the Roman ‘Germaniae’¹;
and instead of hastening at once to Rome, where we are told that his
presence was eagerly desired, he remained on the Rhine and Danube
frontier more than a year longer, carrying out, with his characteristic
thoroughness, the defensive policy which had succeeded to the cam·
paigns of Domitian, and which had evidently commended itself to his
own judgemenrt Terms were made with nations on the spot, the
frontier all along was carefully laid out and strengthened by colonies ,
and military posts³; the ‘limes’ beyond the Rhine, commenced by
previous emperors and carried on by Domitian, was further extended
Ι and now included definitely within the empire the ‘agri decumateS,'
and gave the Romanized settlers a safe footing on that once debatable
land ⁴. At Rome this policy would be regarded with mixed feelings,
· and the more ardent spirits would be disappointed, as it betokened .
that the new ruler, great soldier as he was had not only no intention
of advancing the eagles again to the frontier of the Elbe, but even
considered that the existing position was perilouS, and that circum-
stances might make the German race formidable even for aggression.
Ar such a time Tacitus comes forward to support this prudent policy
with all the force of his eloquence and weight of his position, and to
combine with the literary purpose which may have originally led to
the collection and arrangement of his store of material the present
political aim of familiarising the public mind with the vast extent and ·
overwhelming numbers of the tribes of Gennany‚ the climatic, phy-
sical, and economical obstacles to its invasion and subjugationl, the
