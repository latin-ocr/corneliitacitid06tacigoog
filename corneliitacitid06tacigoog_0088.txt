Civilis placed two sons of his sisters in
high commands (H. 4. 33, 13 5. 2ο, 1).

sanctiorem artioremque, i. e. that

clearly to be a survival from the primi-
tive state of society called matriarchal‚
in which marriage was frequently poly-
androus, and relationships and inheri-
tance were reckouedthroughthe mother,
whose eldest brother had the rights of

sl: heredes tamen, i. e. this tie does
not affect inheritance. In the term ‘li-
beri’ all direct descendants are included;
but Tacitusdoes not distinguish between
sons and daughters, the latter of whom
took anciently no share, and subse-
quently but a small share of the inheri-
tance. Nor does he state what 'took
place if a man left daughters only, nor
mention the father as heir to a childless
son. Some custom of primogeniture is
alluded to in a 32, 4.

accordance with Indian and other early

usage, but in strong contrast to Roman
law. ‘It is doubtful whether a true

it was subsequently introduced into
Germany.

contrast to Rome, where the servility
of legacy-hnnters gave a great social
power to those who were wealthy and
childless. See Hor. 2. 5,10,foll.; Juv.
4, 19; 12, 99, and many other references
in note to A. 3. 25, 2, and in Friedl. i.
