&c Among writers nearer to his own time, he seems to have bor-
rowed from Seneca ¹ the somewhat fanciful figure ‘sepulchrum caespes
erigit' (c. 17, 3), perhaps ‘diem disponere' (c. 3ο, 1), ‘crinem
submittere’ (1 31,1).

This brief sketch of the style of this treatise would be incomplete
without some notice of the literary skill with which transition is made ,
from one part of the subject to another without apparent disconnexion

(see notes on c. 5,1; 6,1; 8,3; 13, 1; 15, 13 17‚4; 11, 1).

Of previous writers he expressly mentions Caesar alone, and him once
only ³. He is thought to have followed him in some other places
also ⁴, but in general must have rested on later authorities, who had in

many points corrected and extended the slight and mostly hearsay ·

knowledge of that date. ln afew places he shows signs of having
studied the geographical work of Pomponius Mela (1.1). 50)⁶, ina
somewhat larger number he appears to follow the ‘Naturalis Historia’
of Pliny ⁴, but seldom without additional details from other sources
To these extant works⁷ we may add others now lost to which he is

have contained some general account of the Germans and their
customs;t there is evidence that Sallust had written something on the
