30 INTRODUCTION

in some respects above the king. To him belongs, as 'a sacred duty,
the maintenance of order in the assemblieS, and the coercion oi
' aThersites ¹, to him alone the indiction of capital or other punish-
ment, as executing the sentence ofa god for a breach ol religion, on
those guilty of misconduct in warh Their ritual bears the marks

ol great antiquity; human sacrifice finding place in it at stated times
in peace ³, and as a kind ol sanctified massacre in war⁴; while their
most characteristic mode ol divination recalls that ol the ancient
Persians¹⁵. Side by side with the regular modes ol divination is the
inspiration ol the prophetess¹‚ who singles herself out among her
countrywomen⁷‚ especially, as it would seem, at the gravest crises,
and sends out her oracles and injunctions srom her secluded
sanctuary⁸.

The principal remaining traits of the description are from a Roman
point of view, and intended to point a pungent contrast. The reader
is to admirc the great free people who limit the power of ruler and
magistrate ⁹, who do not deily mortals ¹⁰, bury their dead without
pomp ¹¹, have never heard of usury¹¹, care no more lor silver plate
than sor earthentvare¹¹‚ and leave amber unheeded on the shore ¹⁴,
who have no hireling gladiators to amuse thern, but only the spear-
dance ol the free ¹¹, among whom the dowcred wile, and all her
intrigues‚ her love-letters, her corruption by licentious plays and
leasts, find no place ¹⁶, where the marriage tic is indissoluble‚ and
unchastity, if not wholly unknown, rare and terribly avenged ¹⁷, where
inlants are neither exposed to die nor neglected and left to foster·
nurses¹⁸, but reared up to a youth of hardihood, uselulnesS‚ and
purity ¹⁹, where there is no gang ol domestics with multifarious
functionS, but the slave has generally a household ol his own, nor
lives in constant scaros stripes and death ¹⁰, where the childless old
rnan wields no social tyranny‚ and is surrounded by no cloud ol
legacy-hunters¹¹.
