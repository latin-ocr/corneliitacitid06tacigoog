THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BV TACITUS 21

lege ¹, and that no other rulers ol the people were necessarily chosen
from its ranks Such rulers or magistrates are designated as ‘prin-
cipes’ and are described as chosen hythe ‘concilium’ of the state
to preside judicially in its local subdivisions² (see below, p. 23).
They arc probably the same who collectively form an inner council
or senate ³, to decide lesser matters and to hold previous debate on
greater, before their· submission to the general body; and who dele-
gate one of their number to the supreme command in war ⁴. They
are probably, again, the same who are spoken of as partly supported
by quasi-voluntary giftsl, and as having the important privilege ol
keeping up and leading to battle a train os ‘comites' (see below,
p. 25). ln this description, as far as it gom, we clearly recognize
the person known later as ‘heretoga‚' ‘herzog' or ‘duke' in war, and
as ‘ealdorman’ or ‘grat' in peace⁶ ; however wide the guli that sepa-
rates the fremy-chosen magistrates ol a democracy from those who ln
later times are chosen by the king, are hereditary, and osten take the
title of the ‘Earl‘ or ‘Jarl⁷.'

acontrast to Rome. Domestic slaves may probably not have been ⁵
numerous, so that he ignores them altogether where wc should most
expect him to mention them ⁹, and describes to us only an extremely
mitigated lorm of bondage on the land, or serfdom, which he compares
to the condition of a Roman ‘colonus ¹⁰,’ representing the bondsman
