nullis, &a ‘with no shows to corrupt
them by their allurements, no banquets
by their incentives) The corrupting
influence of shows upon women is often
noted: see Prop. a. 19, 9; Ov. A. A. 1,
97-1co; Jnv. 11, 201; and many other
passages collected in Friedl'ander, Sit·
tengeschichte, i. 432, foll. The Roman
banquets and their accompaniments are
also often spoken cf as demoralizing:

other references in Friedl. l.l. 435, foll.

4. litterarum secreta, ‘the secrecy
of correspondence.’ The allusion is
plainly to the clandestine love-letters
of Roman ladies (Juv. 6, 277); but it is
perhaps pressing the words too farto
make them mean that the art of writing
was altogether unknown to Germans.

Orelli cites old German laws attesting
all these penalties, and others more
severe, that of death (even by burn-
ing) being permissible. Unchastity
among unmarried women could be
similarly punished by the parent or
guardian.

coram propinquis. These act as
his assessors in the trial. A similar
family tribunal to try the wife was re—
cognized in Roman law even under the
Empire, as is shown in the case of
Pomponia Graecina (A. 13. 32, 3).

8. publicatae enim, &a As the sub·
sequent sentences still relate to married
life, it would be supposed that he is
here also speaking of the adulteress‚
and saying that she could never hope
for a second marriage, which, if rich or
beautiful, she might easily contract at
Rome. This seems weak after what

has gone before, whence it isbetter per- “·

haps to suppose that he means here to
speak, as it were parenthetieally, of the
unmarried. Those who so take it either
omit or bracket ‘enim’ or alter it to
‘etiam,’ cr ‘enim verc,’ or give it an
elliptical meaning: i. e. ‘no wonder that
the penalty for adultery is so severe,
for unchastity generally (even among
the unmarried) finds no pardon.' 1t
would still appear that Tacitus was not
fully avare of the severity of the penal-
