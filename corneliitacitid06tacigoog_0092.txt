similitudinem vini corruptus: proximi ripae et vinum mer-
cantur. cibi simplices, agrestia poma, recens fera aut lac
concretum: sine apparatu, sine blandimentis expellunt famem.

tion is due to the desire to make the
contrast as pointed as possible, and
some reasonable qualification may be
readily understood.

1. Potui, se. ‘est' This predicative
dative, expressing that which a thing or
person serves as, or occasions, is eom-
mon in Tacitus, most frequently in forms
in ‘ui,' as ‘victui' ‘vestitui’ (c. 46, 3),
‘derisui’ (Agr. 39, 1), ‘inrisui' (H. 1.
7, 5), ‘indutui' (A. 1 . 4, a), ‘ obtentui'
(H. 1. 49, 6, &c.), ‘ostentui' (A. 15.
64, ο, &c.). ’

frumento, probably for the specifie
term ‘tritico' (wheat); but it has been
doubted whether the Germans then had
ir. Mead from honey seems to have
been known to all Aryan speaking
peoples (T aylor, 170), and intoxicating
drirrk from grain was known to many
nations and had many names, as ‘zy-
thum’ in Egypt, ‘caelia' and ‘cerea’
in Spain, ‘cervesia’ in Gaul, &e (Plin.
22. 2 5, 82, 164). The old forms of the
words ‘beer' and ‘ale ' may be native
German, but their claim is questioned.
‘Barleywine’ was the common drink of
the Kelts (Gauls) as late as the time of
Julian, whose epigram upon it is pre-
served (Anth. Pal. ix. 3683 see also
Mommsen, Hist. v. E. T. i. 108).

Τίς τόθεν εἷς Διόνυσε; ρὰ γὰρ τὸν

ἀληθέα Βάκχον,
Οὔ σ’ ἔτιγιγνώσκω· τὸν Διὸς οἶδα

ἦ ῥά σε Κελτοὶ

ἀσταχύων.

Τῷ σε χρὴ καλέειν Δημήτριον, οὐ

Διόνυσον,
Πυρργόένη μᾶλλον καὶ βρόμον, οὐ
Β μιον.

2. corruptus, ‘fermented’; the idea
appears to be that of decomposition or
change of nature. K. would take it as
equivalent to ‘in similitudinem vini
corrupti sactus!

et vinum mereantur. This impor-
tation was forbidden in Caesar's time

by the Suebi (4 1, 6), as also by the
Gallie Nervii (a. 16, 4). 88². notes the
German words for wine and all con·
neeted, with winemaking as foreign.

3. eibi, &a It is shown in the fol·
lowing notes that the account of their
food is very defective.

agrestia poma, unenltivated and un·
grafted apples, such as grew in fields
rather than gardens (see note on e. 5, 1).
Such were part of a simple diet even in
Italy (A. 15. 45, 6). The Germans are
known at that time to have had other
wild fruits, berries, nats, &e ; also some
kinds of vegetables, as beans and edible
roots.

reeens fera, game not hung (as at
Rome) to become tender. If hunting
was rare (c. 15, 1), this food must have
been exceptional, and they must also
have caten the flesh of domestic animala,
birds, and fish. The statement of Mela
(3. 3, 28) that they ate raw meat, both
fresh and dried on the skin, is perhaps
true of the latter only; such dried meat
being even now not unknown in some

arts.
p lao concretum (cp.Verg. G. 3, 46 5),
‘ cnrdled milk ’ (‘ dicke Milch ’). Caesar
says of the Suebi (4. 1, 8) ‘maximam
partem lacte atque pecore vivunt,' and
of the Germana in general (6. 22,1)

would show it to be of foreign origin.
Neither Caesar nor Tacitus speaks ofthe
oatmeal pulse, mentioned by Pliny (see
on c. 5, 1) as a chief article of German
food.

4. apparatu: ep. e. 14, 4; here used
of sumptuous luxuries, and further ex-
plained by ‘ blandimentis‚’ ‘provocatives
to appetite,' the ‘irritamenta gnlne' of
Sall. Jug. 89, 7, or the ‘qualia lassum
pervellunt stomachum' of Hor. Sat. 2.
