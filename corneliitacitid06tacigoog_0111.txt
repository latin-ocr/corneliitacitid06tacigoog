1. in claritatem eius referre, ‘ to
assign to his glory.’

consensimus, not necessarily ‘nos
Romani,' but general belief, as implied
iu ‘fama vulgavit?

a. Druso Germanico. The brother
of Tiberius is so spoken ofin H. 5.
19, a. ΤΙιε sumame was not given till
after his death, and was borne by his

, posterity. Suet. (Cl. 1) calls him the
first Roman who sailed the North Sea,
and the same language is used of his
expedition or that of Tiberius in ‘Monu-
mentum Ancyranum,’ v. 14 (see on c. 1,
1): ‘classis mea per Oceanum ab ostio
Rheni ad solis orientis regiones usque
ad fines Cimbrorum navigavit, quo
neque terra neque mari quisquam Ro·
manus ante id tempus adit! It is some·
what strange that no other explorer is
here noticed, hence the suggested read-
ings ‘Druso, Germanico, ‘Druso et
Germanico,‘ ‘Drus0, Neroni, Germa-
1Ῐίω’(οι). c· u, sl· ,

obstitit, here alone with acc. and
inf, analogous to the use of ‘prohi-
,bere’ in H. 1. 62,4; A. 1.69,1; 4
37, 4. The Ocean is personified, as
above in ‘temptavimus’ &c., and con·
ceived to resent the inquiry as au in·
trusion.

3. mcx, ‘afterwards’: cp. c. a, 5.

sanctiusque ac reverentius, ‘more
in accordance with piety and reverence’
Perhaps he speaks ironically‚ as he
seems to regret the want of enterprise
(c. 41, 2).

4. actis, with reference to ‘adiit’
and ‘magnificum'

5. Hactenus, local, ‘to this point' ε
ilidii& likhtssttsstritti
on ‘novimus’ (‘so far to the west is

Germany well known ’), as he here
passes to a less known region.

6. ingenti flexu, the ‘sinus' of c.
37, 1, and c. 1, 1. He appears tc
mean the great recess of Jutland, which
he perhaps took to be a general exten·
sion of the coast, rather thau a penin-
sula, aud to begin further westward.

recedit. This reading is confirmed
by the appearance of a reminisceuce of
a sentence in Mela 3.1, 8 (‘in illam
partem quae recessit ingens flexus ape-
ritur'). On the other hand the MS.
text ‘redit‘ is supported by the ‘redit
. . . Rhodope' of Verg. G. 3, 351.

Chaucorum. This pecple lived
along the coast from the Ems perhaps
to the Elbe, and were divided into
‘ maiores' and ‘ minores’ (A. 11. 19, 3),
parted by the Weser. Their territory
would thus answer to part of Hauo-
ver, Oldenburg, aud Bremen. In part
at least they were subject to Rome
under Tiberius (A. 1. 38,1; 60,3; 2.

bulo was prevented from attacking
them in nu. 47 (A. 11. 19, 6), and they
are found in arms with Civilis (H. 4.
to them as a whole than that of Pliny,
whose general description of them (16.
1, 1') as living 011 hillocks or platforms
surrouuded at high tide, and 'ing
a miserable subsistence by shing,
could only be true of those on the ex·
treme coast. The name is thought to
be from a word signifying ‘ffie high,’
probably iu reference to stature (cp.
Vell. a. 106, 1, cited below), or perhaps
to superiority (cp. t 4).

7. quamquam incipiat: cp.c. 28‚5.
