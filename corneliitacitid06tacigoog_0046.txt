THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BV TACITUS. ι 33

other features of his description lingered long: his terminology also
is often adopted by later writers as answering to distinctions known
to them1. It is true, on the other hand, that criticism has laid bare ’
many errors and defects, of which some have been already dwelt upon,
and others will be pointed out in the notes. In most of them the
blame may fairly be laid on defective means of knowledge, while in
others information already in existence may have been carelessly and
unconscientiously used, and fidelity may have been sacrificed to
rhetorical effect, or affected by the political opinions of the writer ².

Yet to speak of it only as ‘a picture party-coloured, hampered by
modelling itself on the ideas of a fading past, and too often keeping
silence as to elements of really decisivo moment ³,' is to pass on it too
severe and onesided a judgement. With all its shortcomings, no
similar monograph of such fullness and value has come down to us;
and when we consider how the very transpareney of the defects seems
even to point a contrast to the substantial correctness of the rest, how
far the preponderance of what has stood the test of criticism and has
’ been confirmed by later knowledge goes to accredit what we have
no means of criticizing, and how much more we know through this
treatise of the Germans of that date than of any rece without the
Roman empire or of most within it, we can justify the scholars of
the Renaissance in styling it ‘Libellus aureus⁴.’
