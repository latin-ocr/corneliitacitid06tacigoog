aud ‘ colles' os the latter ; i. e. the Chatti
begin within the mountain range, extend
continuously as it opens out, aud end
where it ends. For other views see
SS².‚ K, aud C. B. Others would
adopt the v.·l. ‘durans' (referred to
‘initium ’), or read ‘durantes' (with
‘colles'). Pramm. strikes ont ‘ durant’
altogether. Tacitus would appear in
any case to mean that the Chatti ex·
tended to the plain of north Germany,
which is incorrect.

1. prosequitur. . . . deponit: for
such persenilications cp. ‘bellum ape·
ruit’ (c.1,1), ‘caespes erigii' (c. 27, 2),
and others noted in Introd. p. 11.

2. simul atque, here equivalent to
‘et'...‘et’: cp.c.12,3; 31,4.

striati, ‘close kuit’ (C. Β.), sinewy.

3. et, adding a mental quality to the
physical traits denoted by the asyndeta.

animi vigor, ‘activity ofmind': cp.
Liv. 9. 16, 12.

ut inter Germanos (qnalifying
‘multum '), ‘as the standard is among
Germans’ 3 so ‘ magno ut inter barbaros
praelio' (as read by Halm in A. 11. 17,
53: inc. 2‚4; 22, 2, the meaning is
different.

4. rationis, ‘method‘; the histori-
cal infinitives which follow are epexe-
getical nominatives in apposition.

praeponere eleetos. This is gener-
ally taken to mean that they had no
hereditaryrulers (s'ee Introd. p. 19, note
17): possibly the stress is on ‘electos’
They choose leaders caresully, and obey

. them (‘audire'). Germane in general
did not obey the command ol their

leaders, but followed their example( .
a, Ι).
1 5, nosse ordines, ‘know their place
in the ranks,' like a Roman soldier in
his century. The Germans had an order
of battle (c. 6, 5), but less exact.
intellegere occasiones, ‘to notice
(not overlook) opportunities': cp.‘terga
occasioni patefecit’ (Agr. 14, 4).
differre, ‘reserve for the right
moment.¹ ,

6. disponere diem, ‘ to map out the
day' (have regular hours for different
duties) 3 so in Seu. Cons. ad Pol. 6,
4; Pl. Ep. 9. 36, 1; Suet. Tib. 11.

vallare noetem=‘noctu castra val·
lare’ (make night saie by defences),
a strained attempt at concise antithesis
to ‘disponere diem? Cp. Introd. p. 9.

fortunam, &c.‚ ie. not to reckon on
luek.

8. eoncessum, ‘granted by the ia·
vour of heaven,'a grandiloquent exag-
geration suited to Roman pride. Some
have adopted the reading ‘ratione dis-
ciplinae’ (‘by a system of discipline ').

plus reponere, more fully ‘ plus spei
repositum' (Livy, 2. 39,’1).

9. omne robur, sornewhat stronger
thau what is said of the Germane gener·
ally in c. 6‚4: cpe. 32, 2.

super, ‘besides' a sense frequent in
and aster Livy.
