76 CORNELII TACITI DE GERMANIA

quam amicitias necesse est; nec inplacabiles durant: luitur

Q

enim etiam homicidium certo armentorum ac pecorum numero
recipitque satisfactionem universa domus, utiliter in publicum,

quia periculosiores sunt inimicitiae iuxta libertatem. ,

quemcumque mortalium arcere tecto nefas habetur; pro for·
tuna quisque 'appmatis epulis excipit. cum defecere, qui

5. aliqua Bb.

1. necesse est; it is enforced by
German opinion and moral sentiment.
With them the sacredness of the family
tie and the promptness to resent inju-
ries were exceptionally strong.

neo . . . durant, ‘nor yet do they
(the feuds) continue · irreconcileable.'
The reconciliation of homicide, as the
greatest of sends (ἕ etiam homicidium ')‚
implies that of those rising from lesser
canses.

luitur, &e It is thought by some
that the acceptance of this satisfaction
was not compulsory upon the relatives
ol the slain; and it appears not to have
always ended the feud (see note below).
The principle, however, prevails in some
form almost as generally as that of
blood vengeance itsels. Instances may
be seen in the Homeric poems, as in 11.
9. 632,1ο11., and the ποινὴ ἀνδρὸς ἀπο-
φθιμένου 0f11. 18. 498. In old German
laws the compensation fine is called
‘we'rageldf ‘we'rigelt' or ‘wergeld,'
and is assessed by a regular code ac-
cording to the rank of the slain person
(see Kemble, ch. x). For the payment
of fines in cattle, cp. c 12, 2.

3. universa domus. All members
os the family became parties to the com·
pact to drop the feud. Laws are found
imposing penalties for persistence in it
after compensation. ‘ Satisfactionem ac·
cepit’ is found in Caes. 6. 9, 8.

in publicum, ‘as regarding the
state': this phrase is used in several
places by Tacitus, with the force of
‘publice,’ as A. 2. 48, 1; 11. 17, 43
12. 8, 3: see note on c. 5, 1.

7. defecerit c.

‘illud ex libertate vitium' (c. 11, 3).
For a nearly similar use of ‘iuxta' see
c. 30. 3; and another, founded chiefly
on Sallust, in A. 6.13,1.

5. Convictibus 'et hospitiis, ‘en-
tertaiuments and hospitalities,’ feasts to
each other, and reception of strangers.
The previous subject leads Tacitus to
speak of the treatment of those who,
though outside the family, were pro·
tected by custom; the housemaster being
responsible for· the safe conduct of the
stranger to the next house. The hos·
pitality of the Germans is noted in simi·
lar terms byCaesar (6. 23, 9) : ‘hospitem
violare fas non putant; qui quaque de
cansa ad eos venerint, ab iniuria pro·
hibent, sanctos habent, hisque omnium
domus patent victusque communicatur’ ;

sit is also illustrated from old poems,

and enforced by old law: see SS.

effusius indulget, ‘gives freer rein
to ’: cp. ‘indulge hospitio’ (Verg. Aen.
151)Ι -
ό. pro fortuna, ‘according to bis
means’; so in A. 14. 21, ²3 cp. ‘for-
tunae’ in c. 46, 53 Agr. 31, 2. Here
it is taken closely with ‘apparatis,' ‘well-
fumished' (cp. ‘apparatis accipere epu-r
lis,'¹ Liv. 23. 4, 3, and the substantive
in c-14‚4; 281)-

7. cum defecere, sc. ‘epulae' or
‘cibi' (cp. c. 24, 3). In later times
two or three nights were the limit for
which the right of hospitality could be
claimed.

8. hospes, ‘the host?

monstrator, &c., ‘is his guide and
companion to another lodging': this

4. iuxta libertatem, ‘ by the side of subst. (Verg., Ov., &c.) does not appear

liberty ' = ‘inter liberos ’ς i. e. ‘where ⁴

there is no strong legal control! Cp.

to be in earlier prose.
9. nec interest, ‘there is no distinc-
