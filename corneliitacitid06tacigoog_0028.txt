THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BV TACITUS 15

which any approach is made to so complete an enumeration of tribes
or to so systematic a mapping out of their territory; and in many
cases the locality assigned to a people is confirmed by other autho·
rities sometimes even by modern local survivals of the name¹ ; so
that there is no reason on the whole totdoubt that the distribution
of the country given by him was at the time substantially correct, so
far as correctness was possible in a race among whom the prevalent
internecine seuds might at times bring a hitherto'unknown tribe
into prominence‚ or reduce a once famous name to insignificance
or even extinction²‚ relegate a frontier nation to the forest recesses
of the interior, break up a large people into subdivisions with specific
names ³, or otherwise alter the distribution of territory in ways not
afterwards traceable. It is thus perhaps hardly matter for surprise
that among the comparatively lew names given by his predecessorS,
he omits some that had once been' famous ⁴, or that afterwards
became so ⁵, and that his list of names and arrangement differs much
from that given some fifty years later by Ptolemy ⁶.
