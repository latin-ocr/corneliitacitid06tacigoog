to drunkenness was taken advantage of ways, given, but it was not a trade,

in war (A. 1. 50, 6; H. 4, 79, 3).

not call it easy to subdue them by arms

< 3. ‘Genium &c., ‘they have but one
(in contrast to the variety at Rome) aud
in all gatherings the same public gama!
This is the chief ancient account of what
(by disuse of the ‘framea') was after·
wards known as the sword dance, kept
up till nearly recent times. The games
on horseback called ‘ tiost’ (the ‘joust,’
the origin of the toumament) seem not
to have then existed.

4. nudi; in later times a shirt or
tunic was worn; and the word may be
tak6en here as thus qualified, or as in
c. ,1.

quibus, &c., ‘who make profession
of that exhibitiou ' (cp. A. 1. 52, 4, &c.).
It seems not to have been practised
by all, and was probably confined to
freemen.

5. infestas, ‘held menacingly’ (ep.
‘infestis pilis,’ H. 1. 31, 7), or perhaps
planted in the ground, point npwards:
‘saltu iaciunt’ is stronger than ‘sal-

artem . . . decoram, ‘skill . . .

like that of Roman jugglers, or prac-
tised for wages (‘ mercedem ¹), like the
gladiator's calling.

quamvis, &c., ‘for recklessness‚ how-
ever daring.' It was, no doubt, in origin,
a religious act, probably in honour
of Tiu (Mars), and joined with the
feasts: cp. ‘noctem sollemnibus epulis
ludicram' (A. 1. 50, 4).

7. aleam, &o At Rome dicing was
forbidden by law (see Hor. Od. 3. 24,
58), and, though no doubt common
enough, was tolerated only in hours of
revehy, or at such times as the Satur·
nalia. lu later times it was prohibited
also among the Germans.

substituted.

extremo ae novissimo,‘ the deci·
sive and last throw.‘ The ideas are
virtually the same3 for similar instances,
see lutrod. p. 10.

10. corpore, ‘his person) A similar
custom is recorded of the Huns, and
88². alludes to a poem in the Rig-vedas
and other tales evidencing a prevalence
of gambling among the ancient Indians.

11. iuvenior. Thisrare comparative
form is found in Columella, Pliny mi„
and Appuleius.
