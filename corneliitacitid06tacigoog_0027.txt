ized as deeply recessed and containing islands of vast magnitude²3
while the land is spoken of as taking at a certain point a great bend
northward ⁸. In indicating no other natural boundary eastward than
the Carpathians⁴ heis more consistent with his own conception of
the extent of Germany in that direction than he would have been if
he had followed Mela and Pliny in drawing the line at the Vistula ⁶.
“ He is satisfied to distinguish the vast area included within these
limits into two main portionS, the moist plains of the north and ,
north-west, and the forest and mountain tract ol the south and south-
east ⁰. Ol the rivers by which it is intersected, he specifies only the
Elbe (and that incorrectly ⁷); ol the lorests he notices only the
Hercynian ⁸, and both these apparently for special reasons ⁹. His
work, in short, stands in no comparison with professed geographical
treatises, and he cannot be assumed to be ignorant of all that he has
not mentioned ¹⁰.

His mapping out ol the country among the several tribes is
marked by much of his general vagueness, and would probably have
been far clearer if rivers and other natural leatures had been taken

more account ol. Sometimes definiteness is given by the mention
oi the Rhine or Danube, the ocean, ora mountain tract ¹¹, very often
the position of this or that people is given only relatively to that
of others as ‘a fronte,’ ‘a terg0,' ‘a latere 1²,' and is more and more
vaguely indicated, as is but natural, the more he recedes from the
frontier. We have, however, certainly no earlier extant account in
