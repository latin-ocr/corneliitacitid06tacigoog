SECTION IV.

LANGUAGE AND STYLE.

On the style of Tacitus as a whole, reference must be made to
other works ¹, and attention must here be brielly directed to a particular
phase of it ². To pass through different phases is common to most
authors whose style is strongly pronounced, and whose work is
spread over many years⁸ ; and in the case of Tacitus we have the
additional circumstance of a change of pursuit in middle life from
forensic oratory to historical composition, leading him to form a
style in which the new study was blended with the old.

In the ‘Dialogus⁴’ the style, no less than the choice of subject,
wholly bespeaks a rhetorician, though of a type then perhaps some·
what antiquated, one seeking to reform a decadent eloquence by the

study of the old great masters, especially Cicero, while the usages ·

of the silver age and special Tacitean style are so far latent that
a superficial reader would hardly notice them.

The Agricola and Germania, separated by some fourteen years
from this treatise⁵, and by rather more than that time in the other
direction from the Annalsl, are not strongly marked off in date from
the Histories ⁷, yet a comparison of them even with that work would
' show that they are fully intermediate in style, and represent a period
in which the historiari is still at times subordinate to the orator, who
again is somewhat holding a balance between the more classical
type of the ‘Dialogus' and that of the pleader of his day, compelled
to conform more or less to the exigencies ofa fashion which had
