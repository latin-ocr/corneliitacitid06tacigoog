aglffiioque. in haec munera uxor accipitur, atque in vicem5
ipsa armorum aliquid viro adfert: hoc maximum vinculum,

mulier extra virtutum cogitationes extraque bellorum casus

1. Dotem, &e Tacitus is here ear-
ried away by the apparent contrast to
Roman custom. The nature os the
actual gifts goes to show (what‘ is sully
confirmed, by other evidence), that they
were not a dowry to the wife, but a gift
(like me Homeric ἕδνα) to her parents,
purchasing her, or, more properly, pur-
ehasing the ‘patria potestas' (‘ mund-
walt,’ in mediaeval Latin ‘mundium ')
over her. The Gallie women had ‘ dos,'
and a ldnd of settlement in marriage
(Caes.6.19,r). .

2. intersunt parentes, &e The
family was summoned to approve the
betrothal and delivery of the wif .

munera probant, ‘examine and ae·
cept the gifts.’ The repetition of ‘ mu-
nera’ is considered by some an error of
the seribe; the anaphora of substantives
being rare in Tacitus, and confined to
¹contrasted parallel sentences (Dial. 13,
23A·z·7‚·7;59‚r34·74‚s)- Apyr-
eisely similar repetition of ‘munera rs
found in Propert. 1. 3, 25.

3. non ad, &c., ie. not jewels, nor
articles of the toilet.

4. boves, &e These are paid as
value,as in the caseoffines(c.12, 2)‚&c.

5. inhaecmunera,‘with aviewto

‘under condition of ³) these gifts.' This

orce ol ‘in' is seen in some passages

of Livy, as ‘in has...leges...ictum

{oenus’ (²3· 34, 1); also 34· 35, 1; 42·
. 2, 5.

ra. pariendum Be H M, periendum C,

6. ipsa . . . adfert. This again is
not accurate. Records of ancient mar-
riage customs show that a sword, &c.,
was given to the bridegroom, not by
the bride, but by her father or guardian,
pa'rtly as a valuable present, but chiefly,
it would seem, as a symbol to denote
that she passed under his power.

7. haee areana sacra, ‘these as their
mystie rites;’ alluding to the Roman
nearly obsolete (A. 416, 2) ceremony
of ‘confarreatio’

coniugales deos, as Hymenaeus,
Juno pronuba, &c.; along list is given
in Preller, Rbmisehe Mythologie, ii.
214-219. The simple interchange of
gifts stoodto Gemens instead ofall this.

8. extra virtutum, &e ‘excluded
frorgir aspiring to share in manly heroic
dee s. ,

9. auspiciis, ‘me initiatory cere·
monies.’

11. passuram, ‘destined t0,' &e.: cp.
‘perituri’ (c. 40, 5), ‘servituri' (Agr.
31, r), ‘morituro' (Hor. Od. 1. 28, 6).

12. hoe. . . demmtiant‚ ‘give this
warning! On the presence of women
in war, see c. 7, 3. It hasbeen shown
above that these gists have probably no
such meaning.

sie vivendum, se. ‘esse'3 i.e. in
such indissoluble union.

sie pereundum, in case of defeat;
so most edd. Some follow the majority
of MSS. in reading ‘ pariendum ’; which
