so-called matriarchal system is not untraceable¹‚ but the state os
society as awbole has lar outgrown them. The mixed idea given
us of the hostin battle, with its picked national troops its ‘cuneus'
ol lree families, its groups ol ‘comites' attendant on the ‘principes Ὗ
suggests again a possibility that one form of this organization may
have been prominent with some and another with others ³. Most
of all may this be true of their village life and land system. The
possession of lands by village communities in some form is far too
widespread and manifold to be a characteristic ol any people ⁴, and
often seems to adapt itself to some preexistent institutions, or to
survive in some ways or reassert itself where it has been more or less
departed from, or otherwise to take different forms. Itis at least
clear in Germany that we have the village as a subdivision ol the
‘pagus’ and that it regulated in some way the occupation ol the land
comprised in it ⁶. The chiel description that we have might in most
points approach to a description ol a free village under the ‘Mark'
system ⁰. Yet it would be hold to say thatv permanent individual
possession of land finds no place in the statement ⁷, or that there
might not have been cases in which the whole village was a cluster
of dependente ona common lord ⁸, or that other intermediate forms
of tenure may not have been in existence. Great movements, such
as those which launched the Teutonic tribes against the decaying
· Roman empire, would lead naturally to great changes in ‘these ·
matters ⁹, and itis more remarkable that so much of the account
given in this treatise should be recognizable than that so >much should
have passed away.
