114 CORNELII Τ ACIT I DE GERMANIA

lenocinantur: nigra scuta, tincta corpora3 atras ad proelia
noctes legunt ipsaque formidine atque umbra feralis exer-
citus terrorem inferunt, nullo hostium sustinente novum ac
velut infernum adspectum; nam primi in omnibus proeliis
soculi vincuntur. ’
44. Trans Lugios Gotones regnantur, paulo iam adductius
quam ceterae Germanorum gentes, nondum tamen supra ·
libertatem. protinus deinde ab Oceano Rugii et Lemovii;
omniumque harum gentium insigne rotunda scuta, breves
10gladii et erga reges obsequium.

6. Lygios BCc ligios b. Gothones all, text Med. 1 in A. a. 62. regnant
most MSS. text c and two others. 8. [emonii b¹ H M S, text B C c.

r. lenocinantur, ‘add to the effect the subjects of Maroboduus (A. 2. 62,

of'; so in Dial. 6, 5 (‘ lenocinatur vo-
luptati’), and in Plin. mi. and Quint.
nigra, sc. ‘sunt’

a). Various authorities appear to agree
in making thern live at this timeon the

tincta, ‘painted'

atrae . . . legunt: cp. ‘electa nox
atra' (H. 5. aa, 1).

a. ipse formidine atque umbra,
‘by the mere (cp. c. 13, 4) terrific and
shadowy appearance' (apert from their
fighting qualities).

feralis exereitus terrorem, ‘the
dread of an army of spectres.’ This is
clearly the meaning convcyed by ‘in-
fernum' below, and it seems best so to
take it here; but Wblfflin considers
that a new and distinetly stronger figure
is introduced by ⁴ velut,’ and that ‘se-
ralis exercitus' should mean ‘ an army
like a funeral procession' ε cp. ‘feralem
introitum' (H. 1. 37, 5). The other
meaning seems, however, to be sup·
ported by ‘feralibus . . . tenebris' (‘ the
darkness os death 'y in A. a. 31, a. The
meaning ‘deadly or ‘deathbringing’
(as in ‘bellum...serale’ H. 5. 25, 5)
does not seem to suit the imagery here.

3. nullo hostium,the frequent Taci-
tean and poetical quasi-partitive geni·
tive, without any partitive idea. Cic.
would have said ‘nullo hoste!

4. velut infernum, ‘as it were
hellish.' The expression at least is
stronger than ‘feralis' ii the meaning
convcyed is the same.

6. Gotones, the Gothi ol later his·
tory. They are mentioned by Pliny
(9. 14, 28, 99) as a branch of the Van·
dili, and appear to have been among

right bank of the lower Vistula, ex-
tending to the Pregel, probably the
river Guthalus of Pliny. At the begin·
ppnngscphg third century they were on

e a ea.

regnantur (cp. c. 25, 3): the fol·
lowing words show that this reading is
right. Here the expression is concise
(they live beyond the Lugii, and are
ruled by kings).

iam, probably best taken in a tem·
poral sense (cp. ‘nondum‘), implying
that the power ol their kings was gettin
on: but cp. ‘nullis iarn (ξ 3), auh ·
e.45,2;46,6. ,

adductius, ‘more strictly’ (a meta·
phor srom a tightened rein): cp. ‘ adduc-
tius . . ‚imperitabat' (H. 3. 7, a), &e

7. supra libertatem, ‘so as to over-
power freedom: as in Oriental des·
potisms.

8. protinus ab, ‘immediately bor-
dering on' rin contrast to ‘ipso in
Oceano’ below). These people pro·
bably lived in Pomerania, between the
Oder and Vistula. The name of the
former is preserved further west in the
island os lliigen, and they were among
the later enemies os Rome. The Le·
movii are unknown, and their name has
been taken to mean ‘a branch,’ and to
be perhaps a collective name.

9. insigne: cpe. 38, 2.

rotunda: on the shepes os German
shields, see on c. 6, a.
