THE ACCOUNT GIVEN Bk TACITUS 23

It is only in a few sentences that we learn anything of the aggre*
gate of ‘ vici' forming the ‘pagus ¹,' represented· to us as also ajudicial
centra, and as furnishing its hundred jurors¹ to the court ², and its
hundred picked warriors to the host-⁴¹. It is most commonly identi-
fied with the German ‘Gau' or English ‘shire ⁴‚' but, if so, apparently
with earlier and smaller divisions under such names than those which

Ἰ are historically best known to us ⁶. There is much probability in the

view that the ‘pagus' was really the ‘hundred ⁶,' known to us later
as the chief centre of judicial administration whether criminal or
civil under its presiding ‘ealdorman' and jurors ⁷. The ‘hundred'
as well as the village, was probably at first an aggregate of persons
or families rather than of territorial districts ⁸, and had lost its
numerical significance before we have authentic record of it ⁹.

We have no mention of any division at that time answering to the
province, or to the English shire as later understood¹⁰; the only
gathering above the ‘pagus' being the great ‘concilium' of the
‘civitas' the ‘allthing' or ‘folkmoot' at which all magistrates were

elected, the youth of the nation were solemnly invested with arms ¹¹, ·
