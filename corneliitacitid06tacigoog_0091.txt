dum fingere nesciunt, constituunt, dum errare non possunt.

1. armati: seec.1r‚4; 13,1.

diem noctemque continuare, ‘to
spend the whole day and night'; so
in A. 16. 5, 1. In A. 11. 16, 4‚aGer-
man prince is described as ‘saepius vino·
lentiam ac libidines, grata barbaris, usur·
pans’ It would be implied that at
Rome drunlrenness, however common,
was not equally uncondemned.

2. ut,sc. ‘fierisolet’: cp.c.2 4.

3. caede. SS. notes the frequency of
this as attested by a Salic law holding
the surviving members of the least re-
sponsible in such cases.

transiguntur, ‘are settled)

4. invioem=‘ inter se'3 so ‘miscere
invicem consilia’ (Agr. 38,1)‚&c. Some
would take it adversatively‚ asin c. 21,
3, &c The custom of sealing the re·
conciliation of a quarrel.by drinking
from the same cup is noted as a survival.

adfinitatibus, ‘family alliauces,'
such as those os marriage.

5. principibus, perhaps here ‘duci-
bus’(c.7‚1):cp.‘rex.. . adscisce·
retur’ (A. 12. 10, 4).

de . . . bello. The rising os Civilis
(H. 414, 3) and that against Varus
(A. 1. 55, 3) were thus projected nt
scaeis, and a similar ancient Greek cus·
tom is seen in Hom. Il. 9, 89, loll, &o
Bp. Stubbs notes (p. 30) that these
feasts are a real part oi the ‘concilium’
(c.11,12),and have their couuterpart
in later times.

6. tamquam, assigning the supposed
reason, as in e. 12, 2, &a

7. simplices, ἁπλοῦς, ‘unreserved'3

.· 3. sed deCc, textBb. o· 8. ad hec B, adhec b, ad huc C, ad hoc S, text c.

fs

9. loci ,13² b² H M S and Lips. .

so‘simplicissimeloquimur'(H.1.i5‚8);
‘convivalium fabularum simplicitas’(A. ’
6. 5, a). K. takes it in a sense opposed

10 ‘magnas' as ‘readily understood,’
such as ‘ reconciliandis inimicis,’ in con-
trast to ‘de bello,' &e

8. non astuta neo callida, ‘with-
out natural or acquired cunning,' C. B.

aperit adhue, ‘still continues (cp.

c. 3, 3, &cl to disclose,' in eontrast to t
Romans, who had learnt reticence even ἰ
in their cups (cp. Agr. 2, 3). Somel'
take ‘adhuc' with ‘secreta’ but it ap· ¹
pears to go more commonly with the
preceding word.

9. orgo . . . mens, so stopped by
Halm and Ζ, giving ‘ergo’ its force as
summing np the preceding words. K.
and SS. omit the stop, and take ‘ mens‚‘
somewhat boldly, in the sense os ‘con-
silium’ as subject os ‘retractatur'3 to
which, with the other stopping, some
such general subject as ‘res' must be
supplied from the sense. Some (with
Meiser) read ‘res retractatur!

postera die, &c Herodotus de·
scribes (1. 133, 5) a similar practice
among the ancient Persians.

10. salva . . . ratio est, ‘the regard
paid to either time (advantage accruing
from it) is secured ' : ‘ ratio’ seems here
used in a sense alrin to the expressions

*‘ meae,’ ‘tuae rationes’ (Cic. and Sall.):

cp. ‘cui . . . ratio iuit’ (H. 3. aa, 1).
11. dum=‘tum cum.⁸
constituunt, &c., ‘they decide when
they cannot be misled' (carried away
byexcitement). The obvious exaggera·
