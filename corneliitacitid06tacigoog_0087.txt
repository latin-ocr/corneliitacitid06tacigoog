delegantur, sc. ‘infantes' (change
of subject asin c.18, 4). The same
expression is used in Dial. 29,1 (‘at

nunc natus infans delegatur Graeculae
alicui ancillae’), and the word is a strong
one (c. 15, 1).

11 appears that German females were
then considered marriageable at the age
of fifteen, but even this stands in con-
12221 to the contemporary Roman cus-
tom, in which girls were constantly be-
trothed in infancy, and married at the
age of twelve or even earlier. See
Friedl'ander, Sittengeschichte, i. pp.414,
